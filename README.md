## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
- Got to work with grid a lot on this project
- Learned a little bit about semantic html
  - On this project I used main, footer, sections, and blockquotes
- Did not use it but I tried playing with optimal line lengths*.
- Did not use it but I tried css properties for the values inside hsl colors
  - This allows you to use a property as a color but change the alpha on different selectors.


### Continued development

- I need to learn what to prioritize in layouts. In this layout I tried to make sure each section was filled with the content, rather than making sure each line of text was comfortable to read.

### Useful resources

- [Using rel=”preconnect” to establish network connections early and increase performance](https://css-tricks.com/using-relpreconnect-to-establish-network-connections-early-and-increase-performance/) - This is where I read up on preconnect
- [Elements of a Magazine Page](https://www.magazinedesigning.com/magazine-page-elements/) - A nice article that describes and shows different parts of an article and the corresponding printing term
- [HTML for Subheadings and Headings](https://css-tricks.com/html-for-subheadings-and-headings/) - The resource I used to determine the semantic html to use for headings, subheadings, and pull quotes
- [https://grid.malven.co/](https://grid.malven.co/) - A CSS grid cheat sheet
- [Quoting in HTML: Quotations, Citations, and Blockquotes](https://css-tricks.com/quoting-in-html-quotations-citations-and-blockquotes/) - Where I learned about adding quotes with CSS
- [*Size Matters: Balancing Line Length And Font Size In Responsive Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/balancing-line-length-font-size-responsive-web-design/) - Article on optimal line lengths and comfortable reading.
